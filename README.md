I founded the Chalana ecommerce store in 2016. It was a combination of several things that I liked and wanted to talk about, such as architecture, local artists, heritage and the unknown story behind many art pieces.

The store is currently closed, but I decided to create a landing page to tell a little about this idea and practice my HTML and CSS skills in a simple layout.
